/**
 * The SegmentRingsImageFilter divides segments onion-like in rings.  This
 * filter expects a label image, where the membership to an object is denoted
 * by a common pixel value.  New labels are determined as follows.  The
 * original object label is shifted leftwards by 8 bit and the ring number is
 * stored in the  lowest eight bit.  Ring numbers are counted from the outside
 * to the inside, with the outermost ring having number one.  Pixels of the
 * background, i. e. the value zero, are left unchanged.
